# Midjourney-Chat-HTML-Processor
This repository contains a Python script designed to process HTML files generated from Midjourney chats on Discord. The script extracts images, avatars, timestamps, and text content from the chat logs and restructures them into a user-friendly card-based HTML layout for easy preview.
